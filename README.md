# 👋 Hi, I’m Ali!  

I’m a **Senior Software Engineer** with 10+ years of experience building APIs, backend systems, and cloud infrastructure.  
Currently diving deep into **Python, Next.js, and AI tooling** — while staying grounded in C#, system design, and software fundamentals.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On
- 🌟 **Open Source Contributor** to [LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langchain)  
- 🛠 Building side projects that apply **DSA & OOP** to real-world problems (e.g., [Pathfinder Game](#) | [Home Inventory Manager](#))  
- ✍️ Writing about **technical relevance, system design, and soft skills for engineers** on my [blog](https://aliismail.beehiiv.com/)  

---

## 🧰 Tech Toolbox
- **Languages & Frameworks**: Python, C#, JavaScript/TypeScript (Next.js, React), FastAPI  
- **Data & Infra**: SQL, DynamoDB, Supabase, AWS, Docker, CI/CD pipelines  
- **Specialties**: API design, automation, testing, cloud security, penetration testing (OWASP Top 10)  
- **Exploring**: AI agents, LangChain, and practical machine learning integrations

## 📌 Featured Projects
- 🕹️ **Pathfinder Game**: maze solver using BFS/DFS with dynamic maze generation  
- 📦 **Home Inventory Manager**: QR-based item tracker using Supabase + Airtable  
- 📖 **DSA & OOP Playground**: open-source mini-implementations for learning  

---

## 🎯 What Drives Me
- Bridging the gap between **abstract concepts** and **practical engineering**  
- Helping developers move from **overwhelm → clarity** through structured learning  
- Staying **technically relevant** while growing **leadership & communication skills**
